    <p class="lead">"A human reviews everything" is the sentence that gets AI projects approved, and the practice that kills them. Reviewing everything at assistant speed turns skilled people into rubber stamps — and rubber stamps approve mistakes. The goal isn't more review. It's review pointed at the items that deserve it.</p>

    <h2>Why review-everything fails</h2>

    <p>In week one, agents read every draft carefully. By week four, the drafts have been right so often that reading becomes skimming, and skimming becomes clicking. The policy still says "human in the loop," but the loop has quietly become decorative. Worse, you're paying full review time for it — the assistant's speed advantage evaporates into a queue of approvals.</p>

    <h2>Route by stakes, not by volume</h2>

    <p>The fix is triage. We split every workflow into three lanes before launch:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Reversible and routine — the assistant acts, with spot-checks sampling a few percent</li>
        <li>Consequential — the assistant drafts, a person approves, every time</li>
        <li>Sensitive — refunds beyond a threshold, legal language, an upset customer — straight to a person, no draft at all</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The lanes are decided by the team that owns the outcome, written down, and revisited monthly. What moves between lanes is a management decision with a paper trail — never a silent model update.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>A reviewer who can't say no isn't a safeguard. They're latency.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Make the off switch visible</h2>

    <p>Every deployment we ship has a stop control the team lead can reach without filing a ticket — pause the assistant, drain the queue to humans, carry on. Teams that know they can stop the system trust it faster, escalate sooner, and report problems instead of quietly working around them. The off switch gets used maybe twice a year. Its existence pays for itself every day.</p>

    <h2>What to watch after launch</h2>

    <p>One number tells you whether the loop is healthy: the override rate — how often reviewers change what the assistant proposed. Too high and the assistant isn't ready for its lane. Near zero for months and the review step has probably decayed into theater; sample it and find out. Healthy sits in between, and drifts — which is why someone owns looking at it, by name, on a schedule.</p>
